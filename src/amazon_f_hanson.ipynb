       "> The question of the meaning of life has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and scientists for centuries, and there is no one definitive answer that is universally accepted. However, some common themes that have emerged include:\n",
       "> \n",
       "> * **Purpose:** Many people believe that life has a purpose or goal, whether it is to find happiness, make a difference in the world, or fulfill a specific destiny.\n",
       "> * **Meaning through relationships:** Relationships with other people, including family, friends, and romantic partners, can provide a sense of purpose and meaning to life.\n",
       "> * **Contribution:** Feeling like you are making a contribution to society or to others can give life a sense of meaning. This could involve working in a fulfilling career, volunteering, or simply being there for those you care about.\n",
       "> * **Growth and learning:** Some people find meaning in the pursuit of knowledge, personal growth, and self-improvement.\n",
       "> * **Experiences:** Life can be full of rich and rewarding experiences, such as travel, exploration, and the arts. These experiences can provide a sense of fulfillment and meaning.\n",
       "> * **Legacy:** Some people find meaning in leaving a legacy or making an impact that will outlast them. This could involve raising a family, creating a work of art, or contributing to a cause that you believe in.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> Ultimately, the meaning of life is unique to each individual and can change over time. It is a personal journey of discovery that can be both challenging and rewarding."

      "* **Shorter wavelengths scatter more:** The amount of scattering depends on the wavelength of light. Shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) scatter more than longer wavelengths (red and orange).\n",
      "* **Blue light dominates:** Since blue light scatters more, it is scattered in all directions. Therefore, when we look up at the sky, we see more blue light than any other color.\n",
      "* **Sun's position:** The sky is bluest at the zenith (directly overhead) because the sunlight has to travel the least amount of atmosphere to reach our eyes. Towards the horizon, more scattering occurs, resulting in a whiter or hazier appearance.\n",

      "**Other factors that influence the color of the sky:**\n",

      "* **Aerosols (dust, pollution):** These particles can scatter light and make the sky appear hazy or white.\n",
      "* **Clouds:** Clouds block out scattered light and can make the sky appear gray or white.\n",
      "* **Time of day:** The angle of the sun in the sky affects the amount of scattering and the color of the sky. At sunrise and sunset, the sky often appears red or orange due to increased scattering of longer wavelengths.\n"
